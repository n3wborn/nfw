# NFW

NFW stands for **N3wborn's framework**.

I just wanted to give a friendly name to my own version of Fabpot's [Create Framework](https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/) project.

## Setup

I like to work using Docker but if you don't want to you basically just have to start a php server listening on public/index.php.
So, if you don't want to use Docker, just `php -S localhost:8000 -t src/public`.
